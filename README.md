# ZMQ Patterns

Here I explore various patterns in which I can use ZMQ to better understand its working and use it in my other projects.

## How to run

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -S ..
```

After that, you can enter into any subproject directory you want and build and run it. Each subproject contains seperate README with instructions on how to run it.
